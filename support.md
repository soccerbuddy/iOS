Key Features:

Offline Functionality: Operates entirely offline, making it perfect for locations with limited or no internet access.

Three Main Tabs:

Matches: This is the primary interface where users can create and manage soccer matches.
Clubs and Teams: Users can register at least two clubs, each with its own team, providing the foundation for organizing matches.
Settings: Customize app settings to suit user preferences and requirements.
Match Creation and Management:

Users begin by registering clubs and their respective teams in the 'Clubs and Teams' tab.
In the 'Matches' tab, users can then create a match by selecting from the created teams.
Starting a match is as simple as clicking the central button, which activates a timer to track the match duration.
Event Registration During Matches:

Throughout the match, users can log various events (like goals, fouls, substitutions, etc.).
These events are conveniently listed below the playing field representation within the app, allowing for easy tracking and reference.
This app is ideal for soccer enthusiasts, coaches, and sports organizers who need a simple, effective tool for organizing and tracking local soccer matches and events.
